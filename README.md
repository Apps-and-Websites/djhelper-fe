Mission Statement: To be the easiest way for DJs to collect and display relevant song requests at events.


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features

-    feature one
-    feature two
-    feature three
-    feature four
-    feature five

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack

### Front end built using:


#### React

-    For this app to be successful, it needs to be handy for users to add song requests not only while before an event, but during the event. Therefore, it needs to be very easy to use on a mobile device.
-    Using React with extra consideration to mobile-friendly styling will help, but we'd also like to use React Native to create a mobile version of the app.
-    Using React will make the transition from a web app to a mobile app easier to implement.
-    Our first iteration of our project will be a React web app. Our second will hopefully be adding a React Native mobile app.

üö´List the rest of the front end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above.

#### Front end deployed to AWS.

#### [Back end](üö´link to back end repo here) built using:

#### Express, Postgresql, AWS

-    Using node with an Express server will allow us to query the data science's API as well as handle the requests from the front end.
-    Using AWS with postrgresql will allow us to have data that persists, which will ideal for all users. 
-    Implementing authentication and authorization with hashing (bcryptjs) and JSON web tokens will insure that only authorized users will have access to sensitive data.

# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy¬†... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products
